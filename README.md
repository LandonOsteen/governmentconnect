Goverment Connect
=================

Welcome to the application repository for [Government Connect](https://governmentconnect.net/).

To get started, ensure that you have the latest Ionic CLI installed, then add a folder at the root of the app directory titled `comet_chat`. Paste your CometChat mobile SDK files into this folder. Then run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
ionic serve
```

This should load the app into your browser for local testing.

To prepare for on-device deployment, run `ionic cordova prepare`.

To test on-device, you may run `ionic run ios` to fire up an iOS simulator, or `ionic run android` to deploy to a real Android device. In the latter case, you must have a Android device connected to your computer in order to successfully deploy.
